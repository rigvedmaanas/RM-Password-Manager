# RM Password Manager
A CLI password manager that stores credentials in your local machine encrypted

## Usage

- Hope you have installed python or else go and download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/ "Python") :relaxed:
- First and formost download the code and unzip it. Simple...
- Change the password in the source code (Length of 16 characters)
- Run  `python3 main.py`  in Terminal/Command Prompt as this project uses a clear function and prints a lock in text format which may not work properly sometimes :smile: ...
- You may see some nonsense when you print the passwords
- Delete these passwords and add your own passwords
- There You Go!!!
